# OSINT sources

The following is a list of free, Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) resources that
can be used to quickly and easily search IPs, domains, file hashes, and URLs.
For user convenience, the sources are grouped by category (where appropriate, an
explanatory parenthetical is provided to detail what the source can be used to
accomplish).

This collection of information is gathered from public or open sources and can
help you assess an activity and find background information related to networks,
ISPs, IP addresses, domain names, network tools from various vantage points
